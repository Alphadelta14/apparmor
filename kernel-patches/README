Rather than keep around a set of kernel patches that continually go
stale, this release of AppArmor contains the user space elements only.
Links to current patch sets will be posted to the AppArmor wiki at:

  https://apparmor.wiki.kernel.org/

as well as announced to the apparmor mailing list, which you can
subscribe to at:

  https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/apparmor
