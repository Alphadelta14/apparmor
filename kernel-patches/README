While we've tried to avoid keeping around a set of kernel patches
that continually go stale, this release of AppArmor does contain the
AppArmor backwards compatibility patches to maintain full compatibility
with prior versions of the kernel portion of AppArmor.

Links to current patch sets will also be posted to the AppArmor wiki at:

  https://apparmor.wiki.kernel.org/

as well as announced to the apparmor mailing list, which you can
subscribe to at:
